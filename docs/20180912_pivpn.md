# Install and Configure PiVPN on Ubuntu and Debian

#### Document Highlight
- When I say *simple*, it's really simple
- Simplify OpenVPN setup by [PiVPN](http://www.pivpn.io/). Put all cert and keys into ovpn file
- Enable `tls-crypt`

## Background

I know there are VPN alternatives. I favorite OpenVPN and used to follow-up one instruction posted by DigitalOceans' [How To Set Up an OpenVPN Server on Ubuntu 16.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-16-04) and this [link for Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-18-04).

The documents are very comprehensive and helpful. Specially I really like its `make_config.sh` to put all necessary keys together into one single `*.ovpn` file. How convenient it is :-)

Here I introduce another *extremely* simple setup from [__PiVPN__](http://www.pivpn.io/) which is designed for RespberryPi originally. It also works perfectly with Ubuntu and Debian.

## Steps

#### Install OpenVPN

```
apt install easy-rsa
apt install openvpn
```

#### Install PiVPN

Follow the instruction on [https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn)

```
curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash
```

> Make sure `tls-crypt` is turned on, which is so-called _obfuscated_ network tunnel in encryption.  
> Quoted from one post at [StackExchange.com](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/151194/openvpns-new-tls-crypt-option) - With tls-crypt, all data running on the "TLS channel" is encrypted and authenticated with the same algorithms as the tunnel payload data and with the keys from the static key file. For the TLS payload data (user authentication, key exchange, config push, etc.) this means, this data is encrypted and authenticated twice. Once by tls-crypt and once by the TLS session itself, as a TLS session itself is used to encrypt and authenticate data and, of course, even if tls-crypt is not used, the user authentication, the key exchange, and the configuration push must be encrypted and authenticated

#### Manage PiVPN

```
pivpn add
pivpn revoke
pivpn list
```

Import `*.ovpn` into OpenVPN client. That's it.
