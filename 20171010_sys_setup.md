# Setup Environment

## Doc Objective
- Enhance security of SSH
- Setup hostname
- Update repo

## Milestones

#### Security Enhancement on 1st box
- Add my personal ssh_key to 1st box
```
ssh-copy-id root@IP_ADDR
ssh-copy-id ubuntu@IP_ADDR
```

- Disable password login
Edit ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config```, update

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```
Then ```systemctl restart ssh.service```

> Warning: if your personal ssh key has not been copied (or your key gets lost), you'd lose the access.
#### /etc/hosts

```
127.0.0.1	localhost

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

172.29.167.171	cm01
172.29.167.177	cm02
172.29.167.178	cm03
172.29.167.179	cm04
172.29.167.180	cm05
172.29.167.181	cm06
```
- Copy ```/etc/hosts``` to all hosts

#### Change hostname

```
for i in {2..6}; do echo cm0$i; ssh root@cm0$i "hostnamectl set-hostname cm0$i; exit"; done
```

#### Create a ```ubuntu``` user with ```sudo```

```
for i in {2..6}; do echo cm0$i; ssh root@cm0$i "adduser ubuntu; usermod -aG sudo ubuntu; exit"; done
```

#### SSH Access
- ```ssh-keygen``` on 1st host

- Allow ```ubuntu@cm01``` to SSH into all hosts without passwd
```
for i in {2..6}; do ssh-copy-id ubuntu@cm0$i; done
for i in {2..6}; do ssh-copy-id root@cm0$i; done
```

#### Update ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` to enable ``vi`` mode in Shell (optional)

```
for i in {2..6}; do ssh root@cm0$i "echo 'set -o vi' >> /etc/bash.bashrc; exit"; done
```

#### Update repo
See [the updated source.list](../conf/apt/sources.list).

Run ```sudo apt-get update``` on 1st box. Then populate ```source.list``` to all host and make an update

```
for i in {2..6}; do scp sources.list root@cm0$i:/etc/apt/; done
for i in {2..6}; do ssh root@cm0$i "apt-get update; exit"; done
```
